sinatra_email_opened
====================

This is a little application I wrote to see if your email gets opened. 
I'm using the Gmail gem and sinatra. This will only work if your recipient has images enabled in their email client. 
You also need somekind of web hosting, I'm using my personal website to run the sinatra app. 
The outputs are totally up to you. As of now it prints into the terminal.
The same goes with the key. You could use Base64 gem and pass the persons name + lastname or timestamp and track multiple emails. 

This isnt a framework, just a simple example to make something a little more usable.
