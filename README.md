sinatra_email_opened
====================

This is a little application I wrote to see if your email gets opened. 
I'm using the Gmail gem and sinatra. This will only work if your recipient has images enabled in their email client. 
You also need somekind of web hosting, I'm using my personal website to run the sinatra app.
